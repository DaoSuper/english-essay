If you usually eat breakfast alone, this practice can be really helpful to get your emotions in order.That's because the beginning of the day is one of the most important.

如果你通常一个人吃早餐，这种做法真的有助于理清你的情绪。这是因为一天的开始是最重要的时刻之一。

Having breakfast **in silence** means turning off your **mobile phone**, **putting away** the newspapers, **turning off** the radio, television, and everything that **connects** you **with** the outside world.

安静地吃早餐意味着关掉手机，收起报纸，关掉收音机、电视，以及一切与外界联系的东西。

It's a time to enjoy both what you're eating and the silence.**In fact**, this brief period is a way of **calming your internal waters**.The overall effect is a feeling of greater serenity.

这是一个享受你正在吃的东西和沉默的时刻。事实上，这段短暂的时间是一种平静你内心的方式。整体效果是感觉更加宁静。

If you want to put your emotions in order, the ideal is that every day, you spend five minutes of your time practicing mindful breathing.

如果你想整理好自己的情绪，理想的做法是每天花五分钟的时间练习正念呼吸

A good time to do this is partway through or at the end of the day.You should be in a place where no one can interrupt you.It's even better if there's no external noise and it's a nice place to be in.

做这件事的好时机是在一天的中途或结束时。你应该待在一个没有人可以打扰你的地方。如果没有外部噪音，那就更好了，这是一个很好的地方。

You just have to sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and begin to **breathe in** and out very slowly.You don't have to think about anything.This is not a time for worries, unresolved issues, or plans for later to be running through your mind.

你只需要坐在一个舒适的位置，闭上眼睛，开始慢慢地吸气和呼气。你什么都不用想。现在不是担忧未解决的问题或计划在你脑海中闪过的时候。

3.Prioritize yourself

It's **well worth** introducing an act of personal prioritization each day.Indeed, every day is a good day for **attending to** your needs, your tastes, your preferences, or your dreams.

每天把你个人的行为放在首要地位是值得的。实际上，每天都是满足你的需求，你的感受 及爱好或梦想的好日子。

You may not be able to enjoy big rewards every week, but you can enjoy small and successful ones.**For instance**, sometimes it's enough to just enjoy a warm bath, without **worrying about** anything else.

你可能不能每周都享受大的奖励，但你可以享受小的和成功的奖励。例如，有时只要享受一个热水澡就足够了，不用担心其他任何事情。

**In fact**, a little act of personal prioritization has a wonderful effect on your mood and your enjoyment of life.Therefore, don't ignore it.

事实上，一点点个人优先考虑的行为会对你的情绪和生活乐趣产生奇妙的影响。因此，不要忽视它。

Putting your emotions in order should be something you do on a daily basis.Because, **just as** emotional disorder has a cumulative effect, so does order.

整理好你的情绪应该是你每天都要做的事情。因为，正如情绪失序具有累积效应一样，稳定的情绪也同样如此。

Therefore, if you introduce routines that help you build order on a daily basis, you'll see how, in a short time, your mood becomes more stable.Furthermore, it'll be reflected in all aspects of your life.

因此，如果你引进一些习惯帮助你日常生活中保持有序，你会发现在短时间内，你的情绪会变得更加稳定。此外，它会反映在你生活的方方面面。
