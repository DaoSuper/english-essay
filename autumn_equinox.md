Autumn Equinox lies at the midpoint of autumn, **dividing** autumn **into** two equal parts.After that day, the location of direct sunlight **moves to** the south, making days shorter and nights longer in the northern hemisphere.

秋分位于秋季的中点，将秋季均匀分为两半。在那一天之后，阳光直射的位置向南移动，使北半球昼短夜长。

Here are 4 things you should **know about** Autumn Equinox.

以下是关于秋分你应该了解的四件事。

#### Cool autumn

#### 凉爽的秋天

As it is said in the ancient book, the Detailed Records of the Spring and Autumn Period, "It is on Autumn Equinox day that the Yin and Yang are in a balance of power.Thus the day and night are of equal length, and so are the cold and hot weather."

中国典籍《春秋繁露》记载：＂秋分者，阴阳相半也，故昼夜均而寒暑平。＂

By Autumn Equinox, most of the areas in China have entered the cool autumn.When the cold air heading south meets the declining warm and wet air, precipitation is the result.The temperature also drops frequently.

在秋分时节，中国的大部分地区进入到凉爽的秋季。当向南的冷空气与逐渐减弱的暖湿空气相遇时，就会导致降雨。温度也会频繁地下降。

#### Eating Qiucai

#### 吃秋菜

In South China, there is a custom popularly known as "having Qiucai (an autumn vegetable) on the Autumn Equinox day".Qiucai is a kind of wild amaranth.Every Autumn Equinox day, all the villagers go to pick Qiucai **in the wild**.

在中国南方，有一个俗称“秋分吃秋菜”的习俗。秋菜是一种野生苋菜。每到秋分这一天，村民们都会去野地里采摘秋菜。

Qiucai is taken back and made into soup with fish, called "Qiutang".There is a verse about the soup: "Drink the soup to clear the liver and intestines, **thus the whole family will be safe and healthy**".

秋菜被带回家中，和鱼一起煮成汤，叫做“秋汤”。关于这种汤，有一句俗语：“饮此汤，清肝涤肠，**全家平安健康**”。

#### Season for enjoying osmanthus

#### 赏桂花的季节

The Autumn Equinox is the time to smell the fragrance of osmanthus.**At this time**, it is hot in the day and cool at night in South China, so people have to wear a single layer when it is hot, and lined clothing when it is cool.

秋分是闻到桂花香味的时候。此时在南方，白天炎热，晚上凉爽，所以人们不得不在热时身着单衣，又在凉时添衣。

This period **is named** "Guihuazheng" in Chinese, which means "osmanthus mugginess".

这个时期，也谓之为“桂花蒸”，意为桂花绽放之时，出现的闷热天气。

#### Standing eggs **on end**

#### 立鸡蛋

On Autumn Equinox day, thousands of people **around the world** try to make eggs stand **on end**.This chinese custom has become the world's game.

在秋分这天，全世界成千上万的人们努力把鸡蛋立起来。这项中国习俗已经变为全世界的游戏。

According to experts, on the spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox, the day and night are of equal time both in the southern and northern hemispheres,

据专家表示，在春分和秋分的时候，南北半球的昼夜时间相等。

The earth's axis, on its 66.5 degree tilt, is in a relative balance of power with the earth's orbit around the sun.Thus **it is a very conducive time for standing** eggs on end.

地轴线倾斜66.5度，与地球绕太阳运动的轨道处于相对的力量平衡状态。因此，这是一个非常有利于鸡蛋直立的时间。

But some also say that standing the egg **has nothing to do with** the time.The most important thing is to shift the egg's center of gravity to the lowest part of the egg.In this way, the trick is holding the egg until the yolk sinks **as much as** possible.

但也有人说将鸡蛋立起来与时间无关，最重要的是把鸡蛋的重心移至鸡蛋的最下部。这样，诀窍是握住鸡蛋，让蛋黄尽可能地下沉。
