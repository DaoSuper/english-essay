如果简陋的Kindle不仅不够好，而且你正在寻找电子书阅读器领域的下一个大产品，你可能想看看Sol电子书阅读器，这是一款形状像太阳镜的有趣设备。

Somewhat **similar to** a VR headset, the Sol is a much more simplistic gadget designed solely as a hands-free e-reader.Weighing only around 100 grams and shaped like **a pair of** black sunglasses, the Sol was created for a more comfortable reading experience, like reading a book while **lying down**.

Sol与VR耳机有点相似，是一款更简单的小工具，仅设计为免提电子阅读器。Sol重量约为100克，形状像一副黑色太阳镜，旨在提供更舒适的阅读体验，就像躺着看书一样。

But, before you ask, no, you will not be able to flip pages with your eyes or the power of your mind…

但是，在你问之前，不，你将无法用眼睛或头脑的力量翻页…

The Sol Reader features **a pair of** 1.3-inch side-lit E Ink displays, each **capable of** displaying 65,536 pixels.The device also has a diopter adjustment built in, so people who wear glasses or contact can use it without wearing additional vision correction.

Sol阅读器有一对1.3英寸的侧光E Ink显示器，每个显示器都能显示65536像素。该设备还内置了屈光度调节功能，因此戴眼镜或隐形眼镜的人可以使用它，而无需佩戴额外的视力矫正器。

One of the main advantages of the Sol is that it allegedly blocks out all outside visual distractions, allowing the reader to **focus on** the e-book.

Sol的一个主要优点是，据称它可以阻挡所有外界的视觉干扰，让读者能够专注于电子书。

The pages of the e-book are projected against a dark background and the reading experience is described by the manufacturer as **similar to** looking at the pages of an actual book.

电子书的页面被投影在黑暗的背景下，制造商将阅读体验描述为类似于观看实际书籍的页面。

To **flip through** the pages, users **push buttons** on a remote-like controller, so reading on this thing isn't technically completely hands-free.

要翻页，用户需要按下类似遥控器的控制器上的按钮，所以从技术上讲，阅读这个东西并不是完全不用手的。

The Sol Reader has a built-in battery that should provide about 30 hours of reading time on a single charge, which doesn't seem like a lot compared to conventional e-book readers.

Sol阅读器有一个内置电池，一次充电可以提供大约30小时的阅读时间，与传统的电子书阅读器相比，这似乎不算多。

The storage capacity **is limited to** 64 MB, but the headset wirelessly **connects to** a mobile iOS or Android app that allows DRM-free EPUB files to be copied over, so you don't have to store all your e-books on it.

存储容量限制为64MB，但耳机可以无线连接到移动iOS或Android应用程序，该应用程序可以复制无DRM的EPUB文件，因此您不必在上面存储所有电子书。
