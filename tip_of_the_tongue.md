### [That Tip-Of-The-Tongue Feeling May Be an Illusion](https://web.shanbay.com/reading/web-news/articles/sjaai)
### 话到嘴边却想不起来？可能是种错觉！

Sometimes you know there's just the right word for something, but your brain can't find it.That frustrating feeling is called the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state - and **for decades** psychologists assumed it was caused by a partial recollection of the answer.

有时候你知道有些词刚好描述某件事，但是你的大脑找不到它。这种令人沮丧的感觉被称为舌尖状态——几十年来，心理学家一直认为这是由对答案的部分回忆引起的。

But new research suggests this experience may be largely an illusion.**Being sure** you know something doesn't mean you actually do.

但新的研究表明，这种经历在很大程度上可能是一种幻觉。确信自己知道某件事并不意味着你真的知道。

In **a series of** experiments published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, college students **attempted to** answer 80 general knowledge questions with one-word answers.

在《实验心理学杂志：综述》上发表的一系列实验中，大学生试图用一个单词的答案回答80个常识性问题。

If they didn't provide a correct answer, they were asked if they felt like the answer was on the tip of their tongue and to provide partial information such as its first letter, its number of syllables, or what it **sounded like**.

如果他们没有提供正确的答案，他们会被问及是否觉得答案就在舌尖上，并提供部分信息，如第一个字母、音节数或听起来是什么。

The team found that people in a TOT state were more likely to volunteer partial information - doing so five times as often in one experiment.But that information tended to be wrong.Guesses at sounds and syllable counts were **no more** likely to be right in a TOT state than otherwise.

研究小组发现，处于TOT状态的人更有可能自愿提供部分信息，这是一个实验中的五倍。但这些信息往往是错误的。在TOT状态下，对发音和音节计数的猜测不太可能是正确的。

Averaged across several experiments, first-letter guesses were only slightly more likely to match the correct answer (roughly 11 versus 8 percent).Yet participants said they thought their guess was correct 58 percent **of the time** while in TOT states versus 7 percent otherwise.

几次实验平均下来，首字母猜测只比正确答案稍微有可能一些（大概11比8个百分点）。然而，参与者表示在TOT状态时，他们认为自己的猜测正确的几率在58%，而在其他情况下则仅为7%。

The evidence suggests that instead of partial recollection leading to a TOT state, a reverse process may be **taking place**: something triggers the feeling, which then motivates people to search their memories and to retrieve partial (and usually incorrect) information.

证据表明，与其说部分回忆会导致TOT状态，不如说可能发生了一个相反的过程：某种东西触发了这种感觉，然后促使人们搜索自己的记忆，并检索部分（通常是不正确的）信息。

But the mechanism behind the TOT experience remains a mystery."One possibility is that people detect familiarity with the question itself," says the study's senior author Anne Cleary, a psychologist at Colorado State University."It may be signaling: 'something relevant is here in memory — let's do a search.'"

但TOT体验背后的机制仍然是个谜。“一种可能性是，人们对这个问题本身感到熟悉。” 该研究的资深作者、科罗拉多州立大学的心理学家Anne Cleary说：“它可能在暗示：‘记忆中有一些相关的东西——让我们进行一次搜索。’”

Cleary relates TOT to a similar state: déjà vu, which is especially common in people with certain neurological disorders.In both cases, a compelling feeling of familiarity occurs, and we try to **make sense of** it by telling ourselves we must have seen or learned something before.Confabulation, she says, is more common than we realize.

Cleary将TOT与一种类似的状态联系起来：似曾相识，这在患有某些神经系统疾病的人中尤其常见。在这两种情况下，我们都会有强烈的熟悉感，在我们试图通过告诉自己一定以前见过或学过什么来理解它。她说，困惑比我们意识到的更常见。
