### 这些小细节，说明对方可能在偷偷喜欢你

We may all feel insecure or uncertain when we begin new relationships, wondering if someone really likes us.**None of** us are mind readers, but our bodies and psychology can be telling.

当我们开始新的关系时，我们可能都会感到不安全或不确定，怀疑是否有人真的喜欢我们。我们没有读心术，但我们的身体和心理可以感知。

Luckily, there are some signs that clearly answer this question and can subtly let us know how someone really feels about us.

幸运的是，有一些迹象清楚地回答了这个问题，并能巧妙地让我们知道别人对我们的真实感受。

#### 1.The direction of their feet.

#### 1.他们的脚的方向

If their feet are facing toward you, this can show that they are interested."Open **body language** is an indication that someone is curious and attentive to you," says licensed therapist Shamyra Howard.Other signs can include leaning toward you with relaxed shoulders and uncrossed arms.

如果他们的脚朝向你，这可以表明他们感兴趣。执业治疗师Shamyra Howard说：“开放的肢体语言表明有人对你很好奇和专注。”其他迹象可能包括肩膀放松、双臂交叉向你倾斜。

#### 2.The 2-direction head tilt

#### 2.头双向倾斜

If your crush tilts their head to the side when they're **listening to** you talk, it can be a great sign.The head tilt can show that they're curious and **tuned in**.

如果你的暗恋对象在听你说话时把头偏向一边，这可能是一个很好的迹象。头的倾斜可以表明他们很好奇，并且很专注。

#### 3.They stumble over their words.

#### 3.他们说话结结巴巴。

Another way someone could give away that they're nervous is if they stumble over their words - especially if they're usually confident or the center of attention.

另一种可能让人暴露出他们紧张的方式是，如果他们说话结结巴巴——尤其是如果他们通常很自信或是成为关注的焦点。

"When you know they're not normally awkward, but they're being awkward and can't seem to formulate sentences around you, this could be a sign of interest," says a relationship expert.

一位关系专家表示：“当你清楚他们在正常情况下不会显得笨拙，但在你面前却开始变得很尴尬并且不能够很完整的表达他们所说的含义，这可能就是对你感兴趣的信号。”。

#### 4.They **single** you **out** in a group.

#### 4.他们把你单独挑出来。

In group situations, they find ways to have little moments with you.That could be asking you direct questions or just **responding to** what you've said.**Laughing at** your jokes, looking at you, and making side conversations are good too.

在集体场合，他们会想办法与你共度小时光。这可以是直接问你问题，也可以只是回应你所说的话。为你的笑话而笑，看着你，进行旁敲侧击的谈话也很好。

#### 5.They are consistent in communication.

#### 5.他们在沟通上始终如一。

Consistency in communication is a great indicator of interest.Keeping in touch is key to building relationships, so they shouldn't "disappear" for long periods of time and then come back with no explanation.

沟通的一致性是兴趣的一个很好的指标。保持联系是建立关系的关键，所以他们不应该长时间“消失”，然后回来却没有任何解释。

#### 6.They blush around you.

#### 6.他们在你周围脸红。

Blushing is an honest response to being excited or getting **a dose of** adrenaline.Therefore, it can be a common sign that someone is **attracted to** you - they feel "caught" being excited about another person.

脸红是对兴奋或肾上腺素分泌的诚实反应。因此，这可能是某人被你吸引的一个常见迹象——他们感到“被发现”对另一个人感到兴奋。
