### 连续90天写日记，我学到了什么？

A **little more than** three months ago, I **embarked on** a journey - one that required neither a rucksack nor a plane ticket.Instead, all I needed was a notebook and a pen.

三个多月前，我踏上了一段既不需要背包也不需要机票的旅程。相反，我所需要的只是一个笔记本和一支笔。

I decided to commit to journaling **every single** day for 90 days, **come rain or shine**.No excuses.Just words **on paper**, **day after day**.

我决定在90天里坚持每天写日记，风雨无阻。没有任何借口。只是纸上的文字，日复一日。

Now, as I've **crossed the** finish **line** of this self-imposed challenge, I'm here to share the invaluable insights I've gained, hopefully inspiring you to give this powerful tool a shot.

现在，当我越过这一自我挑战的终点线时，我在这里分享我所获得的宝贵见解，希望能激励你尝试一下这个强大的工具。

1.I'm a great listener — to everyone except myself

1.我是一个很好的倾听者——除了我自己

Most of us spend our days **listening to** others, be it through meetings, phone calls, podcasts, or social media.But in that process, we often **drown out** the most important voice - our own.

我们大多数人每天都在听别人说话，无论是通过会议、电话、播客还是社交媒体。但在这个过程中，我们常常淹没了最重要的声音——我们自己的声音。

In the first few days of journaling, I was astounded by the thoughts and feelings that surfaced, which I'd previously been too busy or too distracted to acknowledge.

在写日记的头几天里，我对浮现出来的想法和感受感到震惊，这些想法和感受是我之前太忙或太分心而无法承认的。

My journal **served as** a platform for my inner self to be heard, and boy, did it have a lot to say.

我的日记为我内心的自我提供了一个平台，天哪，它有很多话要说。

2.My mind is an ocean - sometimes calm, often stormy

2.我的心灵是一片海洋——有时平静，有时又波涛汹涌

Through journaling, I was able to see my thought patterns **like never before**.**Some days**, my journal entries were as calm as a serene ocean, while on others, they resembled raging waves during a tempest.

通过写日记，我能够前所未有地看到自己的思维模式。有些日子，我写的日记像平静的大海，而另一些日子，它们就像暴风雨中汹涌的海浪。

It was a daily exercise in understanding that our minds, much like the ocean, have **ebbs and flows**.Recognizing this helped me learn to navigate my mental seascape better.

这是一种日常练习，用来理解我们的思想，就像海洋一样，有潮起潮落。认识到这一点有助于我更好地驾驭自己的精神海洋。

3.The past is not a prison

3.过往并非囚笼

By **writing about** my experiences, I found that I was able to see my past in a new light.Mistakes were not catastrophic failures, but **stepping stones**.Regrets weren't shackles, but guides showing me a better way forward.

通过写下我的经历，我发现我能够以新的眼光看待我的过去。错误不是灾难性的失败，而是垫脚石。遗憾不是枷锁，而是指引我更好前进的向导。

Journaling became a form of self-forgiveness and a process of **releasing the grip of past events**.

记日记成了一种自我宽恕的形式，也是对过去纠结之事的一种释怀过程。

4.The future is a canvas

4.未来是一张画布

Journaling didn't just make me a historian of my past; it also made me an architect of my future.

写日记不仅仅让我成为我的过去的历史学家，也让我成为了我的未来的创作者。

I was able to plan, dream, and visualize like never before.My entries brimmed with ideas, goals, and hopes, all of which I could revisit, refine, and re-imagine **as many times as I wanted**.

我能够前所未有地计划、梦想和想象。我的作品充满了想法、目标和希望，所有这些我都可以随心所欲地重新审视、完善和想象。

My journal **turned out to be** a priceless tool for personal growth and development.

事实证明，我的日记是个人成长和发展的无价之宝。
