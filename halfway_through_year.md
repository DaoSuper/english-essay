### 2023将过半｜回望来路，再次出发！

As we enter the second half of the year, it's important for all of us to step back and ask ourselves how we're doing, and how things are really going in our lives and careers.

随着我们进入下半年，对我们所有人来说，最重要的是退后一步，问问自己我们的生活和事业真正的情况如何。

Here are three steps you can take to evaluate how the first half of the year has gone and prepare forthe second half:

这里有三个步骤你可以拿来评估这上半年到底如何，并且为下半年做准备

#### 1. Reflect on and answer these questions about your year **so** **far**

#### 1.反思和回答有关迄今为止你这一年的这些问题

People: How effectively have I been building and cultivating my professional relationships and network?What else do I want to do this year to strengthen them?

人：我如何有效地建立和培养自己的职业关系和人际网络？今年我还想做些什么来加强他们？

Plan: How am I doing **so** **far** on the personal and professional goals I set for this year?What do I want to accomplish in the remainder of this year?It's about understanding what you have done, what has changed, and what you want to **focus** **on** next.

计划：目前为止，今年我设定的个人和职业目标做的怎么样了？今年我还有什么想要完成的？这是关于了解你已经完成了什么，发生了什么变化，以及下一步你想要关注什么。

Proof: What have been my proudest accomplishments **so** **far** this year?These don't have to be huge projects and they don't have to be work-related; what matters is that they were important to you.

证明：目前为止，今年什么是我最自豪的成就？这些不一定是巨大的项目，也不一定是与工作相关的；重要的是它们对你很重要。

Priorities: How have my priorities shifted since the beginning of this year?What implications does that have for my life and career?Things in your life may look a lot different than when we started the year.Make sure you do some thinking about these shifts and how they will impact your plans moving forward.

优先权：从年初开始，我的优先权是怎样转换的？这对我的生活和工作有什么影响？你的生活可能看起来和年初有很大不同。确保你思考过这些转变和它们将怎样影响你的计划。

#### 2.Create a plan for the second half of the year

#### 2.为下半年做一个计划

Building from your reflections above, create a high level plan for **the** **rest** **of** the year.Pick **no** **more** **than** three main goals to **focus** **on**, and try to make one of those around **taking** **care** **of** yourself, because we are definitely in a marathon here.

根据你上面的反思，为今年下半年制定一个高水平的计划。选择不超过三个主要目标来关注，并试着围绕照顾好自己制定其中一个目标，因为我们肯定在进行一场马拉松比赛

#### 3.Update your career toolkit

#### 3.更新你的技能包

This one is more tactical, but it's important to do it regularly.You are the owner and driver of your career, and taking a proactive approach is important to ensure you're prepared for performance evaluation conversations or for a planned or unplanned career move.

这一点更多是战术策略，重要的是经常去做。你是自己职业生涯的主人和驾驭者，采取一个积极主动的方法确保你准备职业评估谈话或者一次有计划或者无计划的职业变动，这是重要的。

You don't have to spend a long time on this, but try to:

你不必要花很长时间做这个，但是尝试着去：

Take the accomplishments you listed above and build a few of them out in the STAR format, capturing as many details as you can about what you did and the impact and results of your work.

以您上面列出的成就为例，将它们中的几个建立一个STAR表格，尽可能多地捕捉您所做的事情以及工作的影响和结果的细节。

Update your resume to add any new accomplishments you outlined above and ensure they are current and up to date.

更新你的简历，把上面你概括出来的新的成就添加到其中，确保它们是当前最新的。
