她受到宋代卖花小贩的启发，想通过分发荷花和赠予好运的方式与路人互动。

Inviting her friend, Cai Jiale, who she thought embodies the same essence as the ancient peddler in her imagination, Chen conceived a way of exchanging lotus flowers for answers, and she prepared three questions for passersby, including asking what they would say to graduate students embarking on the next stage of life's journey.

陈邀请了她的朋友蔡家乐，她认为蔡家乐在她的想象中体现了与古代小贩相同的要素，她想出了一种用莲花交换答案的方法，她为路人准备了三个问题，包括问他们对即将踏上人生下一阶段的毕业生会说什么。

"I have received an abundance of blessings, ranging from those meant for families, graduates, to Hangzhou itself.They are all genuine and deeply moving,"she recalls."Numerous passersby **took notice**, with some taking photographs, and I have been fortunate to receive an outpouring of positive feedback."

“我收到了很多祝福，从给家人的、毕业生的，到杭州本身的。这些祝福都是真诚的，令人感动。”。她回忆道：“许多路人都注意到了这一点，有些人还在拍照，我很幸运地收到了源源不断的积极反馈。”
