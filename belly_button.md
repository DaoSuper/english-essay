### 有“盖被基因”？天再热肚子上也得盖被子

In Chinese culture, there is a deep-rooted belief that even the healthiest individuals should never leave their **belly button** uncovered.This curious tradition has garnered significant attention online.

在中国文化中，有一种根深蒂固的观念认为，即使是最健康的人也不应该露出他们的肚脐眼。这一奇特的传统在网上引起了极大的关注。

Many assert that, regardless of the scorching heat, they must protect their **belly buttons at all costs**.

许多人坚称，无论多么炎热，他们都必须不惜一切代价保护自己的肚脐眼。

Some even playfully claim that if stranded on a deserted island without any clothing, they would still find a way to shield their belly buttons, even if it means using a simple leaf.

有些人甚至开玩笑地声称，如果被困在荒岛上，没有任何衣服，他们仍然会想办法来保护他们的肚脐眼，即使只用一片简单的叶子。

Your belly button (the navel) is simply a scar or remnant of the umbilical cord that **connected** you **to** your mother.

你的肚脐眼只是一个疤痕或者可以说是你和你母亲脐带连接的残留物。

The **umbilical cord** provides oxygen and nutrition to a baby during pregnancy, and it is cut and removed after birth, leaving a scar.

脐带在怀孕期间为婴儿提供氧气和营养，在出生后被切割和移除，就留下了一个伤疤。

As the final closing point of the abdominal wall during embryonic development, the skin over the belly button has the thinnest epidermal layer and the weakest barrier function.

作为胚胎发育过程中腹壁的最后闭合点，肚脐眼上方的皮肤表皮层最薄，屏障功能最弱。

Moreover, there are no muscles or fat tissues underneath.Additionally, it is **in close proximity to** abundant nerve endings and nerve plexus, making it particularly **sensitive to** external stimuli and a relatively vulnerable area in the human body, requiring special protection.

此外，它下方没有肌肉或脂肪组织。另外它靠近丰富的神经末梢和神经丛，对外部刺激特别敏感，是人体中相对脆弱的区域，需要特殊保护。

Therefore, it is scientifically sound for Chinese people to be cautious about protecting the belly button.The belly button area is especially susceptible to the invasion of cold winds, even in the hot summer, there is a risk of **catching a cold**.

因此，中国人谨慎保护肚脐眼在科学上是合理的。肚脐眼区域特别容易受到冷风的侵袭，即使在炎热的夏天，也有感冒的风险。

If one doesn't **pay attention to** keeping the abdomen warm and exposes the belly button directly to air conditioning or fans, the cold air can easily enter the body through the belly button, leading to diarrhea, stomach upset, and for women, even painful menstruation.

如果不注意腹部保暖，将肚脐眼直接暴露在空调或风扇下，冷空气很容易通过肚脐眼进入身体，导致腹泻、腹部不适，并且对于女性来说，甚至会出现痛经。

Many people find that adding a weighted blanket to their sleep routine helps to reduce stress and promote calm.

许多人发现，在日常睡眠中加一条加重的毯子有助于减轻压力，促进平静。

In the same way as a hug or a baby's swaddle, the gentle pressure of a weighted blanket may help ease symptoms and improve sleep for people with insomnia, anxiety, or autism.

就像拥抱或婴儿襁褓一样，加重毛毯的温和压力可能有助于缓解失眠、焦虑或自闭症患者的症状，改善睡眠。
