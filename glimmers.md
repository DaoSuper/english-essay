### 在平淡的生活里，找寻那些细小的美好

Glimmers are tiny, positive moments that bring you a mini spike of joy, like when you meet a cute dog in a park, step out into the sun, or take that first perfect sip of iced coffee.

微光是那些给你带来一丝快乐的小美好时刻，比如在公园里遇到一只可爱的狗，走出去享受阳光，或是品尝到第一口完美的冰咖啡。

The term was coined by Deb Dana, a licensed clinical social worker.She recommends keeping an eye out for glimmers as a way to regulate your **nervous system** so you can ultimately feel lighter and brighter - and a lot less triggered.

这个词是由有执照的临床社会工作者Deb Dana创造的。她建议，留意微光是调节神经系统的一种方式，这样你最终会感觉更轻松、更明亮，而且不会太容易被触发。

#### What Are Glimmers?

#### 什么是微光？

Unlike a big vacation, birthday party, or mega-fun night out with friends, glimmers are those small, easy-to-miss moments in your daily life that **bring about** a moment of peace or joy.

与大型度假、生日派对或与朋友共度的狂欢之夜不同，微光是你日常生活中那些容易错过的小时刻，它们会带来片刻的宁静或快乐。

These are things you might walk by every day without noticing, but when you stop to appreciate them, they totally count as glimmers.

这些东西你可能每天都会路过而没有注意到，但当你停下来欣赏它们时，它们完全算是微光。

#### The Benefits Of Glimmers

#### 微光的好处

**Being cognizant of** glimmers is all about **slowing down** and feeling a little more present, which is the opposite of being triggered.

意识到微光就是要放慢脚步，感受更多的当下，这与被触发正好相反。

"By training your mind to **look for** glimmers, you are appreciating the simple joys and moments of everyday life," says Carrie Torn, LMSW, a licensed therapist in North Carolina.

北卡罗来纳州执业治疗师、LMSW的Carrie Torn说：“通过训练你的大脑寻找微光，你就可以欣赏日常生活中简单的快乐和时刻。”。

"You often can develop a greater appreciation **for the** present **moment**, relationships, and the beauty around them - which increases feelings of being grounded, present, and calm."

“你通常可以更好地欣赏当下、人际关系和他们周围的美——这会增加你的踏实感、当下感和平静感。“

As you **look for** glimmers, you might realize how much you accidentally **take for granted**.

当你寻找微光时，你可能会意识到有多少事情是你不经意间认为理所当然的。

"**Over time**, you will also feel empowered and proud of your ability to find glimmers internally and externally faster," says Nyanda A. Sam-King, LCSW, a licensed **mental health** therapist.

“随着时间的推移，你也会为自己能够更快地从内部和外部发现微光而感到被赋予了权力和自豪，”持有执照的心理健康治疗师Nyanda A.Sam King说

"**Looking for** glimmers helps you recognize that joy is always accessible, and finding them throughout your day can enhance the quality of your day overall."

“寻找微光可以帮助你认识到快乐总是触手可及的，并且在一天中找到它们可以提高你这一天的整体质量。”

#### How To Spot Glimmers

#### 如何发现微光

Glimmers are everywhere and they're yours **for the taking**.To find them, Sam-King recommends **looking up** and being more observant.

微光无处不在，你可以随心所欲。为了找到它们，Sam King建议抬头看，多观察。

Scan around you while you walk to work, eat lunch, or go to a store.Is ther a nice breeze?Do you hear someone's funny laugh?If it makes you feel happy or peaceful, it's a glimmer.

当你步行去上班、吃午饭或去商店时，观察周围，是否有微风吹过？是否听到了某人愉快的笑声？那些能让你开心或平静的就是细小的美好瞬间。

It also **helps to** get specific, says Torn.Instead of thinking, "I'm grateful for my dog," a glimmer would be, "I'm grateful I got to walk my dog this morning and she made me laugh when she chased a cat."

Torn说，这也有助于具体化。与其想着“我很感激我的狗”，微光应该是，“我很感谢今天早上我能遛狗，她追猫时让我笑了。”

The idea is that the practice can train your brain to focus on the positive and unexpected events throughout your day rather than the negative, Torn explains."Over time, you can recognize these moments as they occur - and savor them in the present moment."

Torn解释说，这种做法可以训练你的大脑在一天中专注于积极和意想不到的事情，而不是消极的事件。“随着时间的推移，你可以在这些时刻发生时认出它们，并在当下享受它们。”
