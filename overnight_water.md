### [Does a Glass of Water Ever Go Bad?Experts Weigh In](https://web.shanbay.com/reading/web-news/articles/hnasc)
### 隔夜的水，到底能不能喝？

We Know we need to drink a lot of water, but is that water you've **left out** overnight actually OK to drink the next morning or even a couple of days later?And why does the taste of water seem to change overnight?

我们知道我们需要喝很多水，但你放了一夜的水真的可以在第二天早上甚至几天后喝吗？为什么水的味道会在一夜之间发生变化？

Why does water taste different after it's been **sitting out** for 24 hours?

为什么水放置24小时后味道会有所不同？

Chuanwu Xi, molecular microbiologist and microbial ecologist at University of Michigan School of **Public Health**, says that many factors can **result in** that stale, unpleasant taste of water that's been **sitting out** overnight.

奚传武是密歇根大学公共卫生学院的分子微生物学家和微生物生态学家，他指出许多因素能导致放置过夜的水的味道变得不新鲜，令人不快。

**Over time**, chlorine that has been added to tap water to help disinfect it evaporates and changes the taste profile.Carbon dioxide dissolves in water, lowering the pH level and making it more acidic.There may also be **changes in** mineral content.

随着时间的推移，添加到自来水中帮助消毒的氯会蒸发并改变味道。二氧化碳会溶解在水中，降低pH值，使其酸性更强。矿物质含量也可能发生变化。

Water will always **react to** everything around it because it is a universal solvent."It takes odors and it takes flavors," he says.

水总是会与周围的一切发生反应，因为它是一种通用溶剂。“它需要气味和味道，”他说。

For example, if you leave an open glass of water **next to** coffee, the water will smell a bit like coffee **the next day**, even if it doesn't make any contact.

例如，如果你把一杯打开的水放在咖啡旁边，第二天水闻起来就会有点咖啡的味道，即使它没有任何接触。

To keep your water tasting fresh, **make sure** to close the lid or cover your glass to help **keep out** additional bacteria and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide dissolving in your water.

为了让你的水保持新鲜，一定要盖上盖子或盖上玻璃杯，以帮助阻止额外的细菌，减少水中溶解的二氧化碳的数量。

Does water ever **go bad** or expire?

水会变质或过期吗？

Keeping water in a container for a long time can lead to taste changes and **regrowth of microbes** in water, he says.

他说，长时间将水放在容器里会导致味道改变和水中微生物的再生长。

But storing water in a fridge helps prolong its freshness, compared to letting it stay at **room temperature** or near heat, which increases the chances of bacteria growing in your water.

但将水储存在冰箱里有助于延长其新鲜度，而不是让水保持在室温或接近高温的状态，这会增加水中细菌生长的可能性。

For bottled water, most water brands will have an **expiration date** that is one to two years away.But that's more for the container, particularly those made of plastic, than for the water itself.

对于瓶装水，大多数水品牌的保质期是一到两年。但这更多的是为了容器，尤其是那些塑料制成的容器，而不是水本身。

That's because when a plastic bottle starts to break down, chemicals can leach from the bottle into the water.

这是因为当塑料瓶开始分解时，化学物质会从瓶子中渗入水中。

Can old water make you sick?

陈旧的水会让你生病吗？

Experts agree that old water contains more bacteria and could potentially make you sick, Though it does **depend on** what type of bacteria is present and the health status of the person drinking it.

专家们一致认为，陈旧的水含有更多的细菌，可能会让你生病，尽管这取决于存在的细菌类型和饮用者的健康状况。

Finally, it goes without saying that "if a strange color, odor or taste of the water is observed, better not drink those," he warns.

最后，不用多说，“如果观察到水有奇怪颜色、气味或味道，最好不要喝，”他警告说。
