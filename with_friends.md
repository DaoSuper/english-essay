### 和朋友一起，什么都不做便已是最好

In 2013, I went to visit my friend Lydia in Milwaukee.She and I **got ready** together while putting on our makeup and **going-out tops**, and talking about where we were going.

2013年，我去密尔沃基看望了我的朋友莉迪亚。她和我一起化妆，准备外出穿的衣服，谈论我们要去的地方。

We were halfway down the stairs of her apartment building when Lydia stopped, **turned around**, said, "I actually don't want to go out tonight.I just want to **stay in** and **hang out**.Is that OK?"

当我们正走到公寓楼梯的一半时，莉迪亚停了下来，转过身来说：“我今晚其实不想出去。我只想呆在家里闲逛。可以吗？”

I remember feeling immediate relief, because we were already having **a good time** together in her apartment."Yes, of course," I said."That does sound better."We walked back up the stairs, ordered pizza, and played **board games**.And it was fantastic.

我记得我立刻松了一口气，因为我们将在她的公寓中拥有一个快乐时光。我说，“好的，当然，那听起来好极了”。我们从楼梯回到房间，点了披萨，玩了桌牌。好极了！

The simple truth is that the best thing to do with your friends is nothing.

最简单的事实是和朋友之间最好的事就是不做任何事。

Think about the best memories you've shared with your friends **over the years**: the laugh-till-you-cry moments, the birth of new inside jokes, the tearful confessions, the life epiphanies, or even that sweet sense of calm, good-humored security you get from just sharing the same space for a few hours or days.

想想这些年来你与朋友分享的最美好的回忆：笑到哭的时刻，发自内心新的笑话，泪流满面的坦白，生活的顿悟，甚至是在同一个地方待几个小时或者一整天所带来的平静、幽默的安全感。

I'd wager most of them happened somewhere unremarkable.

我敢打赌，它们大多数都发生在不起眼的地方。

Is the reason why we love doing nothing with our friends because it takes us back to the last time that we were doing virtually nothing?

我喜欢和朋友无所事事的原因是它让我回到了上一次无所事事的时候？

There is a level of intimacy that happens when you spend the better part of a year going through life with the same people.When all of your friends are pretty much walking distance from where you live, **hanging out** doesn't take much planning.

当你一年中的大部分时间都和同一个人在一起时，就会产生一定程度的亲密感。当你的所有朋友都住在离你很远时，出去玩不需要太多计划。

You don't need to pack special outfits, make dinner reservations, or **figure out** who will be the designated driver.Visiting a friend with an itinerary that is simply eat, watch TV, play games, and talk?

你不需要收拾特别的装备，预订晚餐，也不需要弄清楚谁将是指定的司机。拜访朋友的日程仅仅只是吃饭，看电视，玩游戏和聊天？

It's like you scheduled a weekend trip back in time, where your **leisure time** was rarely spent alone, and your lives always seemed to overlap.

这就像你安排了一次回到过去的周末旅行，在那里你的休闲时间很少单独度过，你的生活似乎总是重叠的。

I think we underestimate this kind of pleasure because it's tempting to keep chasing something that isn't actually there anymore.We're searching for a fleeting feeling that only exists in memories and movies.

我认为我们低估了这种快乐，因为我们很容易继续追逐那些已经不存在的东西。我们在寻找一种只存在于记忆和电影中的转瞬即逝的感觉。

It's the boundless optimism that doing something elaborate will make us feel bigger, more satisfied, and more alive than what we're doing **right now**.

这是一种无限的乐观主义，认为做一些精心设计的事情会让我们感觉比现在所做的事情更伟大、更满足、更有活力。

The true intimacy of friendship is hard to capture.My closest friendships feel as bright, pink, and sparkly as the disco scene in Barbie, **even if** we're just sitting in a living room, wrapped in blankets, tipsy on hard seltzer, and talking about our lives.It might be nothing, but to me, it's everything.

友谊的真正亲密是难以捕捉的。我最亲密的友谊感觉就像芭比娃娃里的迪斯科场景一样明亮、粉红色、闪闪发光，即使我们只是坐在客厅里，裹着毯子，喝着烈性苏打水，谈论着我们的生活。也许没什么，但对我来说，这就是一切。
