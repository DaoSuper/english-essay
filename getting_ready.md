### 摆脱准备陷阱：在感觉准备好之前就开始

**Getting ready** is fun.Doing research, learning new things, feeling excited about the journey ahead.

做好准备很有趣。做研究，学习新事物，对未来的旅程感到兴奋。

But whether you're **planning on** writing a book, launching a product, or building an exercise routine, **getting ready** can become a distraction: there is a very fine line between preparation and procrastination.

但是，无论你是计划写一本书，推出一款产品，还是制定一个锻炼计划，做好准备都可能会分心：准备和拖延只有一线之隔。

#### Getting ready is holding you back

#### 做好准备会阻碍你

Being successful is not about your ability to plan, but your ability to act.There will always be more planning to do, more scenarios to consider.

成功的关键不在于你的计划能力，而是你的行动能力。总有更多的计划要做，更多的情景要考虑。

Of course, it would be amazing to feel utterly ready.But the reality is that waiting until you feel ready may mean the opportunity to act has already passed.

当然，感觉完全准备好了会很很棒。但事实是，等到你感觉准备好了，可能意味着行动的机会已经错失了。

You may make more mistakes **at first** if you decide to start acting before you feel ready, but the long-term compound effect of learning from these mistakes will get you closer to your goals than **any amount of** preparation.

如果你决定在准备好之前就开始行动，一开始你可能会犯更多的错误，但从这些错误中学习的长期复合效果会让你比任何准备都更接近目标。

The illusion of a perfect time to start is **holding** you **back**.Anyone who has **managed to** put their work into the world most likely started before they were ready.

一个完美的开始时间的错觉正在阻碍你。任何一个成功地把工作投入到这个世界上的人，很可能在准备好之前就开始了。

It's not easy to face the fear of the unknown, especially when it's something you deeply care about.

面对未知的恐惧并不容易，尤其是当这是你非常关心的事情时。

But instead of putting all your hopes and dreams into that single event, you should see your first step as what it is - the first of many steps to come.

但是，与其把你所有的希望和梦想都放在一件事上，你应该看到你的第一步是什么——这是未来许多步骤中的第一步。

#### Why you should start now

#### 为什么你现在就开始

Have you ever spent more time **getting ready** for something than actually doing the actual thing?Maybe it's still the case **right now**?Here's why you should start now.

你有没有花更多的时间为某事做准备，而不是实际做某事？也许现在情况依然如此？以下是您现在应该开始的原因。

You don't know what you don't know.The best and quickest way to learn is through experience.Only then you'll discover what you don't know and will be able to plan accordingly.

你不知道你不知道的东西。最好、最快的学习方式是通过体验。只有这样，你才会发现你不知道什么，并能够做出相应的计划。

Avoid the illusion of productivity.Research shows that we tend to use any justification to keep busy.Reading tutorials or watching fitness videos feels good, but it's just a way to trick your brain into thinking you're being productive by keeping busy.

避免产生生产力的错觉。研究表明，我们倾向于用任何理由来保持忙碌。阅读教程或观看健身视频感觉很好，但这只是一种欺骗大脑的方法，让大脑认为你通过保持忙碌来提高生产力。

Momentum takes time to build up.The choices you make and the actions you take have a **ripple effect**.**Over time**, your efforts will compound.Any time spent not acting is time wasted.

势头需要时间来积累。你所做的选择和采取的行动会产生连锁反应。随着时间的推移，你的努力会变得复杂。任何不采取行动的时间都是浪费时间。

Instead of preparing and research, start before you feel ready.Pick a first step and just do it.Repeat that step unitl you feel comfortable enough, then kick it up a notch.

与其做准备和研究，不如在准备好之前就开始。选择第一步，然后就去做。重复这一步，直到你感觉足够舒服，然后再把它提升一个档次。

When you **look back**, you won't believe how much progredd you've made.

当你回首往事时，你不会相信自己取得了多大的进步。
