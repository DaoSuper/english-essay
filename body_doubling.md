### [Why "Body Doubling" Produtivity Trick Really Works](https://web.shanbay.com/reading/web-news/articles/qdtkl)
### 一人无法专注？不妨找个学习工作“替身”

Body doubling is a technique where you **work on** a task with someone nearby - either in-person or virtually - as a way to stay focused, says Meredith Van Ness, LCSW, a therapist and founder of counseling center Balanced+Well.

心理咨询中心Balanced+Well的创始人、临床医学家LCSW的梅雷迪思·凡·奈斯(Meredith Van Ness)说，你的分身是一种技巧，你可以和附近的人一起工作，不管是面对面还是虚拟的，以此来保持专注。

"This person, known as the 'body double,' is simply there for support and accountability," she tells us."They provide **a sense of** presence and structure, which can help you stay focused, motivated, and on-task."

“这个被称为‘替身’的人只是为了支持和问责，”她告诉我们。“他们提供了一种存在感和结构感，可以帮助你保持专注、积极和专注。”

With the body double in your presence as a witness, the idea is that you're less likely to scroll Instagram, stare off into space, or get distracted by your dog - mostly because you don't want to **let** them **down** by not doing your work.

有了替身作为见证，你就不太可能翻阅Instagram、放空发呆或被你的狗分心——主要是因为你不想因为不工作而让他们失望。

While it's super helpful for people with ADHD, anyone can use the body doubling trick.It'll **come in handy** if your eyes glaze over when working from home or if you tend to procrastinate with chores or admin, like cleaning up after dinner or scheduling a dentist appointment, says life coach Ashlynn Whalley.

虽然它对多动症患者非常有帮助，但任何人都可以使用替身技巧。生活教练Ashlynn Whalley说，如果你在家工作时眼睛呆滞，或者你倾向于拖延家务或管理，比如晚饭后打扫卫生或安排牙医预约，它会派上用场。

"Everyone knows how it feels to put off a task for hours - or days - only to finally start it and be finished in no time," Whalley says."By body doubling with someone, you're being held accountable in a no-judgment, supportive way. This gentle form of motivation can have a huge impact on performance and focus."

Whalley说：“每个人都知道把一项任务推迟几个小时或几天，结果最终开始并很快完成的感觉。”。“通过与某人进行身体加倍，你会以一种没有判断、支持的方式被追究责任。这种温和的动机形式会对表现和注意力产生巨大影响。”

When there's another person nearby to hold you accountable,it's like your brain suddenly clicks **into gear** - and impossible tasks feel possible."It's why many people have a favorite **coffee shop** where they always seem to get so much work done," Whalley explains."It's because other people are working there,too."

当附近有另一个人要追究你的责任时，就像你的大脑突然启动——不可能完成的任务感觉是可能的。Whalley解释道：“这就是为什么很多人都有一家最喜欢的咖啡店，在那里他们似乎总能完成这么多工作。”。“这是因为其他人也在那里工作。”

It's also why it feels so nice to FaceTime a friend while you WFH, or even why "study with me" videos, where someone livestreams their study session, can be such a big help.

这也是为什么在WFH期间与朋友进行FaceTime交流感觉如此美好，甚至是为什么“与我一起学习”视频，有人在视频中直播他们的学习过程，会有如此大的帮助。

Your body double doesn't have to do the same thing you're doing, Whalley says.You can check your emails next to a partner who's watching TV, or put the dishes away when a roommate chats with you in the kitchen.With them nearby, it might even feel like you want to get stuff done.

Whalley说，你的替身不必做你正在做的事情。你可以在看电视的伴侣旁边查看你的电子邮件，或者当室友在厨房里和你聊天时把盘子收起来。有了他们在附近，你甚至会觉得自己想把事情做完。



damfx74笔记：
body doubling我给理解为『你的分身』！人是社会化群居动物，有人陪伴效率更高，谁来陪伴呢，整出一个『你的分身』来就挺合适。大家都写『身体替身』，什么意思？英文body doubling我大概能理解其意思，而给翻译成身体替身我反而晕了，这是正常中文么，我能查到的『身体替身』意思是演戏里的一种工作，身体替身，远景替身，背影替身，裸替什么的，这种解释显然跟本文不搭。
