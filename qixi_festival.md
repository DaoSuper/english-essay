#### Origins

#### 起源

The festival **originated from** the tale of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, one of the four most famous pieces of ancient Chinese folklore.

这个节日起源于中国古代四大民间传说之一的牛郎织女故事。

The story tells of the love between Zhinyu (the Weaver Girl, symbolizing Vega) and Niulang (the Cowherd, symbolizing Altair).

这个故事讲述了织女（织女，象征织女星）和牛郎（牛郎，象征牵牛星）的爱情故事。

As the most capable weaver fairy in heaven, Zhinyu's love for Niulang, a mortal, enraged the gods, who separated the couple with the Silver River (symbolizing the Milky Way).

作为天界最有能力的纺织仙子，织女对凡人牛郎的爱让众神暴怒，并且用银河分开了这对情侣。

Although the gods were consumed with fury, the couple's love did win some of their sympathy, and they allowed the two to meet over the Silver River once a year.

尽管众神被激怒了，但这对夫妇的爱确实赢得了他们的一些同情，他们允许两人每年在银河上相见一次。

On the 7th day of the 7th lunar month, **a flock of** magpies would form a bridge so that the lovers could be reunited.

在农历七月七日，一群喜鹊会架起一座桥，让这对恋人团聚。
