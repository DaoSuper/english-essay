### 当你默读时，脑海中那个声音是什么？

When you first begin reading,you **read out** loud.

当你第一次开始阅读时，你要大声朗读。

**Reading aloud** can make the text easier to understand when you're a beginning reader or when you are reading something that's challenging.**Listening to** yourself as you read helps with comprehension.

当你是一个初读者或者阅读具有挑战性的东西时，大声朗读能够使文章更容易被理解。倾听你自己朗读的声音，能够帮助理解。

**After that**,you might "mumble read",That's when you mumble,whisper or move your lips as you read.But this practice slowly fades as your reading skills develop,and you start to read silently "in your head"."That's when your inner voice **comes into play**.

后来，你可能喃喃的阅读。喃喃的阅读是指当你阅读的时候，你含糊的说话，小声说话或者动动嘴唇。但是随着你的阅读技能的发展，这种习惯慢慢的消失了，你开始在脑海中默读。这是你内部的声音起作用的时刻。

As experts in reading and language,we see this transition from reading **out loud** to silently **all the time**.It's a normal part of the development of reading skills.Usually,kids **are good at** reading silently by the fourth or fifth grade.

作为阅读和语言领域的专家，我们一直会看到这种从大声朗读到默读的转变。它是阅读技能发展过程中正常的一部分。通常，小孩子在四岁或五岁的时候善于默读。

The shift from reading **out loud** to reading silently is very similar to how kids develop thinking and speaking skills.

这种从大声朗读到默读的转变与孩子如何发展思维和说话技巧的非常相似。

Young children often **speak to** themselves as a way to **think through** challenges.As kids become better thinkers,they shift to talking inside their heads instead of **out loud**.This is called "inner speech."

年轻的孩子经常对自己说话，并把这当做一种全面思考挑战的方式。随着孩子成为更好的思考者，他们变的在脑海中说话，而不是大声说出来。这被称作内部谈话。

Once you're a good reader,it's a lot easier to read silently.Silent reading is more flexible,and it allows you to focus on what's most important.And it's during silent reading that you may discover your inner voice.

一旦你成为一个良好的读者，默读就会容易的多。默读更灵活，它使你能够专注于最重要的内容。当你默读的时候，你可能会发现自己内心的声音。

Developing an inner voice

发展内心的声音

Hearing an inner voice while reading is relatively common.**In fact**,one study found that 4 in 5 people say they often or always hear an inner voice when they read silently to themselves.

当阅读的时候，听到内心的声音相对常见的。事实上，一项研究发现，5个人中有4个人说他们在自己默读的时候，经常或总是听到内心的声音。

It's also been suggested that there are many types of inner voices.Your inner voice might be your own:It might sound **similar to** the way you speak or might be just like your spoken voice.Or it might assume a different tone or timbre altogether.

也有人认为，内心的声音有很多种。你的内心声音可能是你自己的：它听起来可能与你说话的方式相似，也可能与你说的声音一样。或者它可能呈现出完全不同的音调或音色。

A study of adult readers found that the voice you hear in your head may change **depending on** what you are reading.For example,if the lines in a book are spoken by a specific character,you may hear that character's voice in your head.

一项针对成年读者的研究发现，你在脑海中听到的声音可能会随着你所读的内容而变化。例如，如果一本书中的台词是由一个特定的角色说的，你可能会在脑海中听到这个角色的声音。

So,fear not if you start hearing a bunch of voices in your head when you dive into a book - it means you've already become a skilled silent reader.

所以，当你埋头读一本书时，不要担心脑海里开始听到一堆声音———这意味着你已经成为了一个熟练的默读者。
