### 常见的营养误区，快来看看你中招没！

We spoke with experts to debunk some of the most common nutrition myths you've probably heard.

我们与专家进行了交谈，以揭露您可能听到的一些最常见的营养误区。

#### Myth 1: Carbs Are Bad

#### 误解1：碳水化合物不好

Both of our experts were quick to share that the idea that carbs are bad is completely untrue.

我们的两位专家都很快就分享了碳水化合物不好的想法是完全不正确的。

Tanya Mezher explained that carbohydrates serve as one of the three macronutrients in our diets, and provide a crucial source of energy to our bodies.

Tanya Mezher解释说，碳水化合物是我们饮食中三大重要营养素之一，并为我们的身体提供了至关重要的能量来源。

"When consumed, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose which is used to fuel various functions in our body.The quality and variety of carbohydrates do matter and some are better than others," said Mezher.

Mezer说：“当摄入时，碳水化合物会分解成葡萄糖，葡萄糖用于促进我们身体的各种功能。碳水化合物的质量和种类确实很重要，有些比其他更好。”。

"Low-carb diets for weight loss are really popular **right now**, but it is a misconception that carbohydrates on their own will make you **gain weigh**t," said Serena Poon.

Serena Poon说：“低碳摄入来减重目前是非常流行的，但是人们认为碳水他本身是会导致增重出现的概念是错误的”。

#### Myth 2: Fewer Calories Means More Weight Loss

#### 误区二：卡路里越少，体重就下降得更多

While **opting for** a low-calorie diet might be effective in helping you lose weight quickly initially, Poon shared that it has the potential to lower your "resting metabolism" over time, which could be counterproductive to your goal of **losing weight** **in the long run**.

虽然最初选择低热量饮食可能会有效地帮助你快速减肥，但Poon分享说，随着时间的推移，低热量饮食有可能降低你的“静息代谢”，从长远来看，这可能会对你的减肥目标产生反作用。

Your resting metabolic rate is the total number of calories your body burns while it is at complete rest.The more calories you consume, the higher your metabolic rate will be.This means that if you consume fewer calories, your metabolic rate has the chance of severely decreasing.

你的静息代谢率是指你的身体在完全休息时燃烧的卡路里总数。你消耗的卡路里越多，你的代谢率就越高。这意味着，如果你消耗的热量越少，你的新陈代谢率就有可能严重下降。

Therefore, if you choose to consume fewer calories or start a low-calorie diet, **over time**, you are **slowing down** your metabolism, and generally not supplying your body with the energy it needs.

因此，如果你选择摄入更少的卡路里或开始低卡路里饮食，随着时间的推移，你的新陈代谢就会减慢，通常不会为你的身体提供所需的能量。

#### Myth 3: All Fat Is Bad Fat

#### 误区三：所有的脂肪都是坏脂肪

The "fat-free" or "low fat" movement started in the late 1970s, and it stuck around for years.From a nutritional perspective, though, choosing foods with "low fat" or "fat-free" attributes can be detrimental to your health.

“无脂肪”或“低脂”运动始于20世纪70年代末，并持续了多年。然而，从营养的角度来看，选择具有“低脂”或“无脂”特性的食物可能对你的健康有害。

"Fat is actually necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins, **not to mention** brain and cellular function as well as hormone production amongst others., shared Mezher.

Mezer分享道：“脂肪实际上是吸收某些脂溶性维生素所必需的，更不用说大脑和细胞功能以及激素分泌等了。”。

Mezher went on to explain that it is important to consume healthy, unsaturated fats, such as avocados, nuts seeds, and olive oil as opposed to saturated or trans fat.Saturated and trans fats are often found in fatty meats and processed foods.

Mezher接着解释说，与饱和或反式脂肪相比，食用健康的不饱和脂肪很重要，如鳄梨、坚果籽和橄榄油。饱和和反式脂肪通常存在于高脂肪肉类和加工食品中。
