### 暑假｜你记忆中的暑假是怎么样度过的？

**Writing about** my summer vacations is not just an article for me;it's a feeling that I am reliving with every word I write.

写我的暑假对我来说不仅仅是一篇文章；这是一种感觉，我正在重温我写的每一个字。

The summer vacations were a whirlwind of excitement,filled with various games,new friends,and captivating stories.Perhaps yours were too,because we didn't have smartphones back then.

暑假是一个激动人心的旋风，充满各种游戏、新朋友和迷人的故事。也许你的也是，因为当时我们没有智能手机

We had to create our own entertainment.From swinging on tree branches to playing tag,our days were spent in joyful pursuits.We would **immerse** ourselves **in** the world of our favorite comic books.During the bustling afternoons,while the elders took their leisurely breaks,we would craft kites and prepare the string for flying.

我们必须创造自己的娱乐。从在树枝上荡秋千到玩捉迷藏，我们的日子都在追求快乐中度过。我们会沉浸在我们最喜欢的漫画书的世界里。在繁忙的下午，当长辈们悠闲地休息时，我们会制作风筝和准备放飞的线。

Exploring and wandering during vacations were also essential.Visiting Nani's house was quintessential,and we eagerly awaited the **summer holidays** for that.I remember that **as soon as** the holidays began,our aunt would be the first to visit,and we would spend the whole day playing with our cousins,learning new games,some from them and some of our own.

假期间的探索和闲逛也是必不可少的。去奶奶家是典型的做法，我们热切地盼着暑假的到来。我记得，假期一开始，第一个来拜访的就是姑姑，我们会花一整天的时间和表兄妹们一起玩，学新游戏，有向他们学的，有我们自己的。

For those who couldn't come,we would diligently write letters,**providing** them **with** all the updates and eagerly awaiting their responses.Every afternoon,we would anxiously **wait for** the postman,clutching postcards, creating countless memories.

对于那些不能来的人，我们会勤奋地写信，向他们提供所有最新的信息，并急切地等待他们的回复。每天下午，我们都会焦急地等待邮递员，紧紧握着明信片，创造了无数的回忆。

And when it was time to **bid farewell** to our aunt and prepare to visit Nani's house,the excitement would build.The journey to Nani's house **starts with** a train ride,an essential part of the adventure.

当我们要告别姑姑，准备去奶奶家时，兴奋之情油然而生。去奶奶家的旅程从坐火车开始，这是冒险的重要组成部分。

The sound of the tea seller's voice,though not melodious,always brought refreshing energy,even on scorching hot days.The tea,roasted peanuts,and seasonal fruits sold by vendors at each station,as the **ebb and flow** of passengers at every stop,made this journey with strangers feel so familiar.

卖茶的声音虽然不悦耳，但即使在酷热的日子里，也总能带来令人耳目一新的能量。每个车站小贩出售的茶、烤花生和时令水果，随着每一站旅客的来来往往，让这段与陌生人的旅程变得如此熟悉。

Nani's house,the unpaved roads of a small town,choosing any path always led us to our destination,In these rough,dusty streets,every road welcomed you and guided you without letting you lose your way.

奶奶家，一个小镇的土路，走哪条路都能通向目的地。这些崎岖不平，布满灰尘的街道上，每条路都欢迎着你，指引着你而不会让你迷路。

There was such a sense of belonging in these unpaved paths that they never allowed you to feel like a stranger.People warmly greeted you,despite the **lack of** modern amenities,and while there may have been fewer conveniences,there were also fewer hardships.Now,there are more conveniences,but there are also more difficulties...

在这些未铺设的小路上有一种归属感，他们从不让你觉得自己是陌生人。尽管缺乏现代化的便利，人们还是热情地迎接你，虽然便利可能更少，但困难也更少。现在，便利更多了，但也有更多的困难...

My summer vacations are adorned with golden memories.I hope that as you read this,it evokes memories of your summer vacations.

我的暑假充满了珍贵的回忆。我希望当你读到这篇文章时，它能唤起你对暑假的回忆。

Share your memories too….

也分享你的回忆。
