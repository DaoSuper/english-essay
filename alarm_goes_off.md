### 在闹钟响之前醒来的人，是被啥叫醒的？

At the center of your brain,a clump of nerves - called the suprachiasmatic nucleus - oversees your body's clock: the circadian rhythm.It determines when you feel sleepy and when you feel bright-eyed.It controls your blood pressure,your body temperature,and your sense of time,It turns your body into a finely tuned machine.

在你的大脑中心，有一簇神经————被称为社交叉上核，它负责监管你身体的生物钟：即昼夜节律。它决定了你何时感到困倦，何时感到精神饱满。它控制你的血压，你的体温，和你的时间感。它将你的身体调整为一台精细调节的机器。

That machine happens to love predictability.Your body is most efficient when there's a routine to follow.So if you hit the hay the same time each night and awake the same time each morning,your body locks that behavior in.And that's where things get sciency.
