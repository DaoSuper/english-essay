### [How Popping Open a Can Became the Sound of Summer](https://web.shanbay.com/reading/web-news/articles/gfthp)
### 冷知识：易拉罐的拉环是怎么发明的？

"Pshhh!""Tsssk!""Fwshawww!"However you spell it, it's the sound of summer: the peal of a pop-top cracking a cold can.

“噼啪！”“咝嚓！”“噗呲啦！”无论你如何拼写它，这都是夏季的声音：冷饮易拉罐被拉环撕开的爆裂声

The pop-top, the umbrella term for the various tab openers that have graced the crowns of cans over the last 60 years, is a patently American invention.It can be heard at cookouts and concerts, block parties and ballgames.

易拉罐，这是过去60年来出现在各种罐装饮品顶部的开启器的总称，显然是美国人的发明。在烧烤和音乐会，街区派对和球赛中都可以听到它。

But it wasn't heard at all until Ermal "Ernie" C. Fraze, a Dayton, Ohio, inventor, found himself at a 1959 picnic, peeved and unable to open his beer.

但直到1959年俄亥俄州代顿的发明家Ermal“Ernie”C.Fraze在一次野餐中恼火地发现自己无法打开啤酒，这个声音才首次被人们听到。

A church key is a small, double-edged metal tool found in many kitchen drawers - one side is triangular-tipped for piercing metal cans, the other rounded for opening bottles.(The bottle-opener side resembles the handle of an old-fashioned church key; hence, the name.)

教堂钥匙是一种小型双刃的金属工具，存在于许多厨房抽屉中——一面是三角形的，用来刺穿金属罐，另一面是圆形的，用来打开瓶子。（开瓶器的侧面类似于老式教堂钥匙的把手，因此得名。）

In the 1950s, when opening a beer, drinkers punctured a triangular hole in either side of the top of the can - one hole for drinking, the other for airflow.

在20世纪50年代，人们打开啤酒时，会在罐顶的两侧各刺了一个三角形的洞——一个用来喝酒，另一个用来通风。

Had Fraze remembered his church key at that 1959 picnic - had he never **been forced to** wield his car fin as a can opener - we might not have the modern pop-top.But the owner of Dayton Reliable Tool Company, a **machine tool** business, did forget his church key, and while the episode maddened him at the time, it had him uttering that age-old inventors' creed: "There must be a better way."

如果Fraze在1959年的那次野餐中记得他的教堂钥匙——如果他从来没有被迫把汽车尾翼当作开罐器——我们可能就不会有现代易拉罐。但这家机械工具公司的所有者，忘记了他的教堂钥匙，尽管这件事当时让他很恼火，但却让他说出了那句古老的发明家信条：“一定有更好的方法。”

"Other people had the same idea.It's just Ermal Fraze brought it to fruition," says Peter Liebhold, curator emeritus in the Division of Work and Industry at the National Museum of American History."His picnic story actually diminishes how smart he was.

“其他人也有同样的想法。只是Ermal Fraze实现了这一想法。”美国国家历史博物馆工作与工业部名誉馆长Peter Liebhold说：“他的野餐故事实际上削弱了他的智慧。

With any invention, you have to accomplish three things: You have to develop a good idea; then scale it, or bring it to market, which is incredibly difficult; and finally, you need people to adopt the idea, which doesn't always happen.With the pop-top, Fraze **succeeded in** all three.And it became an incredibly **big deal**."

对于任何发明，你必须完成三件事：你必须发展一个好的想法；然后推广她，或者将其推向市场，这是非常困难的；最后，你需要人们接受这个想法，但这并不总是发生的。Fraze在这三件事上都取得了成功。这成为了一件令人难以置信的大事。”

**Thanks to** the ingenuity of Ermal "Ernie" C. Fraze, we now find ourselves, ice-cold can in hand, **listening to** the sound of summer:"Pshhh!""Tsssk!""Fwshawww!"

感谢Ermal“Ernie”C.Fraze的独创精神，我们现在发现自己，手里拿着冰冷的罐子，听着夏天的声音： "Pshhh!""Tsssk!""Fwshawww!"

"What else **sounds like** the opening of a pop-top?It's a Dayton-invented sound," says Kress."**All around** the globe, **billions of** times a year, people hear this sound.And it comes from a device that is seemingly so simple.But it's changed how people live."

“还有什么听起来像易拉罐的声音？这是代顿发明的声音。”Kress说：“在全球范围内，人们每年都会听到数十亿次这种声音。它来自一种看似简单的设备。但它改变了人们的生活方式。”
